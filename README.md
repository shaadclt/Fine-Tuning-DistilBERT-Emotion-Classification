## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates end-to-end fine-tuning of DistilBERT for emotion classification and its deployment as a production-ready web application. The system transforms raw textual input into emotion predictions using a fine-tuned transformer model, enabling real-time emotional analysis through a clean and lightweight web interface.

## 🧠 Research Abstract
This project presents a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for multi-class emotion classification. Leveraging transfer learning, the model adapts contextual representations from a pre-trained transformer to capture nuanced emotional expressions in text. The fine-tuned model is deployed via a Flask-based application that enables real-time inference. The approach demonstrates how transformer-based architectures can be efficiently adapted for emotion recognition tasks while maintaining strong performance and deployment scalability.

## 🎯 Why Fine-Tune DistilBERT?
Fine-tuning allows a general-purpose language model to specialize in emotion recognition. This process significantly improves classification accuracy over zero-shot approaches by learning task-specific linguistic patterns. DistilBERT provides an ideal balance between performance and efficiency, enabling low-latency inference suitable for real-world applications.
